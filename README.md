# Food-Group

## User Story
As a foodie I want to make certain meals but don't know how. I want to be able to search for a list of ingredients as well a recipe.  Additionally I want to know what is the nearest grocery store to buy the ingredients so that I have instructions for the recipe and know where to get them.

## Acceptance Criteria
As a Food App user:
* WHEN the user searches for a Recipe THEN a list of recipes is shown.

* WHEN the user selects a recipe THEN on a modal the full recipe is diplayed. (Content pulled from API: Recipe image, recipe card, list of ingredients, and cooking instructions.)

* WHEN the user clicks on the ("`Grocery Stores`") link  THEN they are shown an embedded google map with the users nearest grocery store.
